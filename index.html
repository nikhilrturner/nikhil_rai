			<section id="quizzler">
				<h2>Quizzler App</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Built an interactive quiz app which asks the user 15 True/False questions and maintains a score keeper to display the overall score at the end for Android as well as iOS platforms using flutter with Dart on Android Studio</li>
				<li>Created a new class ‘QuizBrain’ which keeps track of all the questions, answers and the question number and incorporated this class in the main Dart file to update the question and score when the user selects an answer</li>
				<li>Incorporated various Flutter compatible packages and created customisable Flutter widgets using Dart</li>
			</ul>

			<section id="phasemeter">
				<h2>Digital Phasemeter</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Designed a circuit to estimate the phase difference between two sine waves with resolution 1ms</li>
				<li>Used Opamp, XOR gate, AND gate and 555 timer to produce 1ms pulse for a duration equal to the phase difference</li>
				<li>Employed a BCD counter to count the number of pulses and displayed it on a seven-segment display</li>
			</ul>

			<section id="xlr8">
				<h2>Bluetooth Controlled Electric Car</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Designed and built a wireless android app-controlled car capable of traversing a path filled with obstacles</li>
				<li>Gained experience with RF Modules and Arduino chipsets for controlling and learnt designing on PCBs</li>
				<li>Developed a data sending and receiving unit using HC-05 Bluetooth module and used light materials for the chassis for high speed acceleration of the bot to complete the designated race circuit in minimum time</li>
			</ul>
			</section>


			<section id="mlwebapp">
				<h2>Machine Learning Web App</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Built a fully interactive Machine Learning web app with the Streamlit library in Python</li>
				<li>Imported Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest Classifiers packages from scikit-learn to implement linear model, kernel method and tree based ensemble method for training the model</li>
				<li>This web app allows users to choose the classification algorithm, and interactively set hyper-parameter values and displays the Accuracy, ROC curve, Confusion Matrix and Precision recall curve of our model for given dataset</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Hobbies</h1>
			<p>
				After talking about the projects and technical skills, I would like to share some hobbies of mine.<br>
				I like playing sports like football, cricket and hockey alot. I even trained in NSO Hockey for the entire 2018-19 academic year and achieved following goals in the field of sports:
				<ul>
					<li>Secured 1st position in Hockey in ‘Raftaar 2019’, a sports competition for all Freshmen</li>
					<li>Represented Hostel 16 in Hockey GC 2019</li>
					<li>Helped the team to secure 1st Runner up position in Institute Hockey League 2019</li>
					<li>Completed 4.7 km run and helped Hostel 3 to secure 1st position in Crossy GC</li>
				</ul>

				Apart from sports, I also enjoy the world of cinema alot. I love watching movies in my free time. My favourite genres include inspirational, romantic, sci-fi, thriller, and mystery. The Dark Knight Trilogy and Interstellar are my all time favourite movies. I also enjoy acting just as much I enjoy watching the movies. 
				<ul>
					<li>Directed and acted in a youtube video for SilverScreen IITB Ad Making Freshiezza 2018</li>
					<li>Acted as the main antagonist in the short film made by Hostel 3 for the IITB Film GC 2020</li>
				</ul>
